# Exploring Microsoft Copilot in Microsoft Edge
In this DIO - AI900 course challenge, I explored how Microsoft Copilot can help me create new content and be more productive.

In this repository, two directories can be found: Input (the prompts used in the challenge) and Output (what the Generative AI created from the prompts I inserted).

Before starting, it is important to have a Microsoft account (Outlook, Hotmail or Live) and have the Microsoft Edge browser installed.

This challenge can be found as an exercise on Microsoft Learn, so I used the recommended inputs in it.

## Step by Step:
### 1. Using Copilot to explore the document and research an idea:
1. In Microsoft Edge, browse to OneDrive and sign in using your Microsoft account.
2. Now, open the document [Business idea](https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/mslearn-ai-fundamentals/raw/main/data/generative-ai/Business%20Idea.docx), the document will open in the Microsoft Word when you click it (if you have the app installed your computer) search the Microsoft word in the Edge browser and load the document. 
3. View the text in Business Idea.docx, which describe some high- level ideas for a cleaning business in New York City.
4. Use the Copilot icon on the Edge toolbar to open the Copilot pane.
5. In the Copilot pane, scroll down to see all of the contents as necessary, and ensure that the Chat tab is selected and that the conversational style is set to More Balanced - this will ensure that Copilot responds with a balance of creativity and factual precision.
6. Copy the following prompt and paste in the Copilot:

        What is this document about?

    _If prompted, confirm that you want to allow Copilot to access the page and acknowledge that the conversation will not be saved._

7. The response from Copilot should be a summary of the main points in the document (_first_ file in the output directory).
8. Now, copy and paste the following prompt:
        
        What's the market opportunity for this business idea?
9. The response should provide some insights from the Web that may be useful when planning a new cleaning business in NY (_second_ file in the output directory).
10. Last prompt to copy and paste in this part of the challenge:
         
         How do I go about setting up a business in New York?
11. The response should contain some advice and links to resource to help you get started setting up a business in NY, maybe with some more prompts to get more information as well (_third_ file).

### Use Copilot to create content for a business plan:
1. With the Business Idea.docx document still open in Microsoft Edge, in the Copilot pane, enter the following prompt:
        
        Suggest a name for my cleaning business
2. Select a name from the suggestions for your cleaning company or continue prompting to find a name you prefer.
3. Enter the following prompt:
        
        Write a business plan for "name of your company" based on the information in this document. Include an executive summary, market overview, and financial projections.
4. Analyze the response and, under the output, use the _Copy_ icon to copy the clipboard then select all of the text in the Business Ideas document and paste the text.
5. Now, enter the following prompt:
         
         Create a corporate logo for the cleaning company. The logo should be round and include an iconic New York landmark.
    _You can also choose your own idea of logo, even asking for Copilot an idea_ (_fourth_ file)
6. The response should be four options for a logo created by Microsoft Designer, you can continue to edit it putting more prompts to iterate the design as you wish.
7. When you get happy with the result, right-click the logo you prefer and copy it to the clipboard, then paste it into the top of the business plan document (My result can be found in the output directory as _Final Business Plan_).

### Use Copilot to create content for a presentation:
1. In the Documents folder in OneDrive, add a new PowerPoint presentation, if the Designer pane opens, close it.
2. On the title slide for the presentation, enter the the name of your cleaning company as the title, and **_Investor Opportunity_** as the subtitle.
3. Add a new slide, using the Two Content slide layout (which includes a title and two placeholders for content).
4. Change the slide title to **Benefits of Hiring a Commercial Cleaner**.
5. In the Copilot, enter the prompt:
        
        Write a summary of the benefits of using a corporate cleaning company for your business. The summary should consist of five short bullet points.
6. Copy Copilot's response and paste it into the left content placeholder, deleting the initial sentence then reformat the text in the placeholder as you prefer.
7. In the Copilot pane, enter the following prompt:

  Create a photorealistic image of a clean office.

8. When Copilot has generated an image you like, copy it to the clipboard and paste it into the content placeholder on the right of the slide. (_If the Designer pane opens automatically, select a slide design you like. Then close the Designer pane._)

9. Apply any additional reformatting you like.

10. On the PowerPoint title bar, select the default presentation name (Presentation) and rename it to **_Business Presentation.pptx_**.

11. Save it in your computer, or not, the challenge it's finished (my file can be found in the output directory).
